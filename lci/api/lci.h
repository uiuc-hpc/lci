 *
 * The LCI runtime offers users various communication operations for
 * sending and receiving messages. According to the size and number, the
 * messages can be divided into short, medium, long, and iovec messages. LCI
 * provided different operations (with s, m, l, v as suffix) for those messages.
 * LCI uses different protocols for these messages. According to who provides
 * the send and receive buffers, the operations can be divided into 2sided and
 * 1sided operations (send/recv v.s. put/get). For medium send/recv buffers and
 * long recv buffers, the communication operations can either use user-allocated
 * buffer or LCI-provided buffer. The later one can save one memory copy.

/**
 * @defgroup LCI_PROGRESS LCI progress functions
 * @ingroup LCI_API
 * @brief Make progress on the background works to make sure the runtime
 * functioning properly.
 *
 * All communication runtimes have some background work to do, such as
 * pre-posting some receive buffers to the network, polling the network
 * completion queue, serving for some communication protocols, and executing
 * active message handlers. MPI chooses to do them as a side effect of some MPI
 * function calls (such as MPI_Test, MPI_Wait). LCI chooses to provide users
 * with an explicit function so that users can control when and how to make
 * progress on these background works.
 *
 * Caveat: The progress functions have to be called frequently to make sure
 * all communication operations can complete.

/**
 * @defgroup LCI_MEM LCI memory management
 * @ingroup LCI_API
 * @brief Management for memory buffers registered to the network.
 *
 * In most of the cases, memory buffers participated in a network operations
 * need to be registered to the network. The LCI runtime can do this for
 * users through either memory copies to a pre-registered buffers or dynamical
 * registering and deregistering. LCI also exposes relevant functions regarding
 * registered memory allocation and memory registration to the users so users
 * can do communication operations more efficiently.
 *
 * For small messages, the send data does not need to be registered since the
 * data will be packed into the low-level network operation descriptors.
 *
 * For medium messages, the send and receive buffers need to be registered. If
 * users are using the "copy" version of operations (e.g. @ref LCI_sendm, @ref
 * LCI_putm, @ref LCI_recvm), the data will be copied to/from pre-registered
 * buffers by the runtime. If users are using the "no-copy"version of operations
 * (e.g. @ref LCI_sendmn, @ref LCI_putmn, @ref LCI_recvmn), users will directly
 * get access to the LCI internal pre-registered buffers through either
 * @ref LCI_mbuffer_alloc (for send buffers) or completion mechanisms (for
 * receive buffers).
 *
 * For long messages, the send and receive buffers need to be registered, and
 * the cost of memory copies to pre-registered buffers is considered unworthy.
 * As a result, either users or the runtime needs to explicitly register the
 * buffers.
